# Description  <a name="toc-appdescription"></a>

Create an application to generate a random password based on criteria the user selected. This app will run in the browser. The password can include special characters.

I want to use JavaScript to create randomized passwords for a user based on strings. I want to use the console to see if my code works.

https://lisamlorenz.github.io/password_generator/

### Write JavaScript code that prompts user input and based on that creates a random password:

* Generate a password when the button is clicked
  * Present a series of prompts for password criteria
    * Length of password
      * At least 10 characters but no more than 64.
    * Character types
      * Lowercase
      * Uppercase
      * Numeric
      * Special characters

  * Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected

  * Once prompts are answered then the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page
