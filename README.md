# Module 5 Challenge: Password Generator

### Write JavaScript code that prompts user input and based on that creates a random password:

* Generate a password when the button is clicked
  * Present a series of prompts for password criteria
    * Length of password
      * At least 10 characters but no more than 64.
    * Character types
      * Lowercase
      * Uppercase
      * Numeric
      * Special characters

  * Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected

  * Once prompts are answered then the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page
